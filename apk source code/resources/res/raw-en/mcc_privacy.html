<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your interest in data protection when using your Monsieur Cuisine connect kitchen appliance ("Monsieur Cuisine connect", "MCC").</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The following data protection notice is designed to inform you about how and to what extent your personal data is potentially processed when you use your MCC. Personal data is information that identifies you or could identify you directly or indirectly. The statutory basis for data protection is, in particular, the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<h2>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data processing in offline mode</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Purposes of the processing/legal bases:</u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We only process your personal data when your MCC is connected to a wireless network (WIFI).

<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you send or hand over your appliance to Lidl customer service for maintenance or repair, we also collect and use information obtained from error diagnostics to pursue our legitimate interest in the technical development of the MCC and in improving our products and services (e.g., recipes).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Storage time/criteria for determining storage time:</u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If we return your appliance to you after repair instead of replacing it, your appliance will continue to process your data. If we read or store the data on your appliance while performing error diagnostics, we will delete the data after the warranty periods have expired (after 5 years at the latest).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to data processing for the purposes of troubleshooting, please also note the privacy policies of the Lidl company where you purchased your appliance or where you sent your device for repair (e.g., at https://www.lidl.de/c/datenschutz/s10007528).</p>
