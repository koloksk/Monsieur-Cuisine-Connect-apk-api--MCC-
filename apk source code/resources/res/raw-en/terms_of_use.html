KG, Stiftsbergstra&szlig;e 1, 74172 Neckarsulm, Germany, Registry Court Stuttgart, HRA 102314 (hereinafter referred to as "Lidl") offers a platform for collecting recipes, etc., on the <a href="http://www.monsieur-cuisine.com">monsieur-cuisine.com</a> website ("Website") and the "Monsieur Cuisine" app ("App") (the Website and App hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Platform").</li>
        <li>The Platform is provided by Lidl solely on the basis of these Terms of Use. The user may access the current version of the Terms of Use or download or print them out at any time on the Website at <a href="https://www.monsieur-cuisine.com/de/impressum/#c28644">https://www.monsieur-cuisine.com/de/impressum/#c28644</a> and in the App under "Profile, privacy &amp; terms of use".</li>
        <li>We do not save the text of the agreement after contracting. The user may access and download the Terms of Use in the main menu of the App or on the Website at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration</h3>
    <p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users need not be registered to view the publicly available information on the Platform</p>
    <p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to use the Platform, post reviews, comments, recipes and photos, users must register and create an account. Registration can be done through the App once it has been downloaded.</p>
    <p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When using the Platform in conjunction with Monsieur Cuisine Connect, the user makes a binding offer to register for the Platform and use the services by clicking on the "register" button in the App or on the "register now" button on the Website and entering all the required information, user name and password and then clicking on the "done&rdquo; button or the "register and create user account" button.</p>
    <p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The user does not incur any costs by making this Offer. Until the user clicks on the "done" button or the "register and create a user account" button, registration can be aborted or the information changed at any time by deleting, supplementing or correcting the information entered in the different fields or closing the App. After the registration process is complete, users can change their details at any time in their personal account.</p>
    <p>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the Offer to enter into the agreement, the user will receive a confirmation of receipt of the Offer ("Order Confirmation") to the e-mail address provided during the registration process. This Order Confirmation also constitutes Lidl's acceptance of the Offer ("Formation of Contract") and will contain a verification link. The Platform can be used as soon as the user has confirmed the verification link contained in the e-mail.</p>
    <p>2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Lidl provides the Platform voluntarily and free of charge, Lidl may refuse to allow users to set up an account in the individual case without providing a reason.</p>
    <p>2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The e-mail address the user provides may not be assigned to any other account. The user must not provide an e-mail address or other contact information that does not belong to them, especially not "disposable" e-mail addresses. Users must store their Login Data securely. The user must not give other persons access to their account.</p>
    <p>2.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every interaction with Lidl via the user's account will be attributed to the user. This is also the case if third parties have interacted via the account and were able to use the account due to culpable conduct on the part of the user. The user must notify Lidl without undue delay of any unauthorized use of the account and change the Login Data if there is reason to suspect that the account is being used by a third party.</p>
